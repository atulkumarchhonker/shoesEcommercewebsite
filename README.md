The Home Service Provider project employs a modern technology stack to deliver an efficient and user-friendly experience. Here's a brief overview of the key technologies and libraries used:

- **Frontend**:
  - **Javascript**: The frontend is built using javascript, a popular JavaScript for building user interfaces. javascript component-based architecture allows for better code organization and reusability.
  - **Ant Design and Tailwind CSS**: We utilize Ant Design and Tailwind CSS frameworks for UI components and styling. These frameworks provide a wide range of pre-built components and utility classes, allowing for rapid development and consistent design.
  - **Recharts**: For data visualization, we utilize Recharts, a composable charting library built on javascript components. It enables us to create interactive and visually appealing charts to present data to users.
 
  - Our technology stack is carefully chosen to optimize performance, scalability, and maintainability, ensuring a seamless experience for our users.
- #### Start Frontend
    Use `npm run start:client` or `yarn run start:client` to start the frontend.
